## Previous Year Questions

Q1. a. **Draw a decision boundary of OR function, when given x1, x2 and x3 inputs to the McCulloch Pitts Neuron. Also write an equation of that decision boundary**

Ans. 

To create a decision boundary for the **OR** function implemented using a McCulloch-Pitts neuron with three inputs ($x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$), we consider the following steps:

### **OR Function**
The output of the OR function is defined as:
$y = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } x_1 + x_2 + x_3 \geq \theta, \\
0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}$

For an OR gate, the threshold ( $\theta$ ) is **1** because at least one input must be 1 for the output to be 1.

So the decision boundary is the equation:
$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = \theta.$
Substituting $\theta = 1$ :
$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 1.$

This is the equation of the plane that separates the inputs into two regions:
- **Above or on the plane ( $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 \geq 1$ )**: Output is 1.
- **Below the plane ( $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 < 1$ )**: Output is 0.
